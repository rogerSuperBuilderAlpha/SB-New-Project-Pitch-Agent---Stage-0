# Example S0 Pitch: FractionFlow

> This is a complete example of a high-quality S0 pitch that would receive a PASS grade. Use it as a reference for structure, specificity, and clarity.

---

## 1. One-liner

### Format A: Business Structure
For middle-school math teachers who struggle to close fraction gaps in mixed-proficiency classes, we help them achieve two times mastery velocity within thirty days by generating personalized practice and quick checks aligned to the district scope and sequence.

**Natural restatement**: We help middle-school math teachers double how fast students master fractions by creating personalized practice that fits exactly what each student needs.

---

### Format B: Movie Pitch
It's like Khan Academy meets Quizlet, but with auto-generated intervention plans based on error patterns and real-time alignment to district pacing guides.

---

## 2. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### School Category
**Target**: Alpha Middle School (our pilot school)
**Sister schools**: Beta Academy Network charter schools (grades six through eight)

---

### Inclusion Rules

**Grade band and subject**: Grades six through eight, math (fractions and pre-algebra)

**School type and setting**: Charter schools with one-to-one Chromebook programs and flexible intervention blocks

**Workflow constraints**: Teachers have twenty to thirty minute intervention blocks twice per week, need to show mastery progress on district benchmarks

**Required tools or platforms**: Google Classroom integration required, district uses Illustrative Math curriculum as scope and sequence

**Minimum scale**: At least one hundred students per grade level to make intervention grouping effective

---

### Exclusion Rules

**Grades or subjects out of scope**:
- Elementary grades K through five (foundational number sense requires different approach)
- High school algebra two and above (different skill gaps)

**Settings that block your approach**:
- Schools without reliable internet or one-to-one devices
- Districts that prohibit third-party tools or require year-long procurement cycles
- Schools using mastery-based progression already (limited pain point)

**Programs where your target gap rarely appears**:
- Advanced or gifted programs where fraction fluency is prerequisite
- Alternative schools with attendance below sixty percent (cannot maintain practice consistency)

---

## 3. Strategic Narrative

### Why Now (Macro Timing)
Adaptive content generation and auto-scoring have become good enough and cheap enough to personalize at the student level. Three years ago this would have required human tutors. Today we can deliver the same diagnostic precision at software margins.

### Status Quo / Enemy (Current Problem)
Static worksheets and canned problem sets force teachers to spend hours finding or creating materials for each proficiency level. Remediation cycles take weeks because teachers cannot quickly identify error patterns and generate targeted practice. Students who fall behind stay behind.

### Promised Land (Your 10x Improvement)
Students progress twice as fast on priority fraction standards while teachers recover meaningful prep time. Instead of two months to reach proficiency, students get there in one month with stronger retention.

### Proof (Why You Are Credible)
- We ran a four-week pilot with two math teachers at Alpha Middle School. Students in intervention groups progressed one point four times faster on released items compared to baseline.
- Our curriculum advisor spent twelve years designing math interventions for charter networks and has validated our item bank against state standards.
- We have API access to Illustrative Math scope and sequence data for alignment checking.

## 4. Distribution and Platform

**Platform**: Distributed through TimeBack platform.

**Day-one access**: Teachers add FractionFlow as an assignment in TimeBack. Students click the link, sign in with their school Google account, and start their first diagnostic. No app install, no new passwords, no IT approval needed beyond initial tool whitelisting (which Alpha Middle School has already completed).

**Integration blockers**: None. Alpha Middle School already uses TimeBack for all assignments and has whitelisted our domain for single sign-on.

## 5. Measurable Outcome (The Centerpiece)

### 1. What you will improve (Primary Outcome)
**Primary outcome**: Mastery speed on priority fraction standards (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of fractions with unlike denominators).

---

### 2. How much you plan to improve (Target)
**Target**: Students will reach proficiency twice as fast compared to baseline (business-as-usual intervention).

---

### 3. How long it will take (Time Window)
**Time window**: Within thirty days of starting the program.

---

### 4. How you will measure it (Measurement Plan)
**Measurement plan**:
- We will use teacher-approved pre-tests and post-tests built from released state assessment items
- We will track days from program start to proficiency (defined as eighty percent correct on post-test)
- We will compare intervention students using FractionFlow against baseline data from the previous semester's intervention students (same teachers, same standards, same entry scores)
- Sample size: Approximately sixty students across three intervention sections
- We will include a forty-eight-hour delayed retention check (re-test same skills two days after hitting proficiency) to verify learning is not just short-term recall

---

### 5. What counts as success (Decision Thresholds)

**Green (Success)**: FractionFlow students reach proficiency in fifteen days or less (half the baseline thirty-day average) AND maintain at least seventy-five percent accuracy on the forty-eight-hour delayed check.

**Yellow (Needs More Work)**: Students reach proficiency in sixteen to twenty-two days (faster than baseline but not two times) OR delayed retention drops below seventy percent.

**Red (Not Acceptable)**: Students take twenty-three days or more to reach proficiency (no meaningful improvement over baseline) OR delayed retention below sixty-five percent (learning is not sticking).

---

### Complete Statement
Our primary outcome is mastery speed on priority fraction standards. We aim to help students reach proficiency twice as fast as baseline (in fifteen days instead of thirty days) within the first thirty days of the program. We will measure this using pre-tests and post-tests built from released state items, comparing time-to-proficiency against previous semester baseline data across approximately sixty students in three intervention sections. We will include a forty-eight-hour delayed retention check to verify learning retention. We will consider this successful if students reach proficiency in fifteen days or less with at least seventy-five percent delayed retention, needs more work if they reach it in sixteen to twenty-two days or retention drops below seventy percent, and not acceptable if they take twenty-three days or more or retention is below sixty-five percent.

## 6. Assumptions and Risks

### Assumption / Risk 1: Student Engagement
**What we assume**: Students will complete approximately twenty minutes per day of practice with minimal teacher prompting.

**How we will test it**: In week one we will require a three-day engagement streak and measure daily drop-off rates. If completion falls below seventy-five percent, we will add streak cues, progress badges, and reduce initial session length to twelve minutes. We will check engagement metrics daily and adjust by end of week one.

---

### Assumption / Risk 2: Curriculum Alignment
**What we assume**: Our generated items align tightly to the Illustrative Math scope and sequence that Alpha Middle School uses.

**How we will test it**: We will sample ten generated items per week and have the lead math teacher grade alignment on a three-point rubric (aligned, partially aligned, misaligned). If more than one item per week is misaligned, we will immediately review and adjust our item generation parameters. Weekly audits continue through the entire pilot.

---

### Assumption / Risk 3: Measurement Validity
**What we assume**: Our diagnostic and practice items actually measure deep understanding of fractions, not just procedural recall.

**How we will test it**: We will include a forty-eight-hour delayed retention check in every measurement cycle. If students score well on immediate post-tests but drop more than twenty-five percentage points on delayed checks, we know we are measuring short-term recall and need to revise item types. We will analyze this after the first cohort (approximately twenty students) completes the cycle.

---

### Assumption / Risk 4: Operator Load
**What we assume**: Teachers can set up and launch FractionFlow in fifteen minutes or less without technical support.

**How we will test it**: We will time three teachers (one experienced with tech tools, two less comfortable) through the setup process using only our written guide. If any teacher takes more than fifteen minutes or gets stuck, we will rewrite the setup guide and add screenshots. We will complete this test before launching with all three intervention sections.

---

### Assumption / Risk 5: Unit Economics
**What we assume**: Our AI generation and grading costs stay under two dollars per student per month, allowing us to price at fifteen dollars per student per month for a six-week payback.

**How we will test it**: We will track generation and runtime costs per student from day one. If costs approach three dollars per student, we will optimize our generation prompts and caching strategy. We will review unit economics weekly and adjust pricing or costs to maintain target margins.

## Key Lessons from This Example

1. **Specificity wins**: "Twice as fast" beats "faster." "Fifteen days vs thirty days" beats "quicker mastery."

2. **Numbers make it real**: Sixty students, three sections, fifteen dollars per student, two dollars unit cost, forty-eight-hour delayed check.

3. **Plain English throughout**: No jargon, no abbreviations, complete sentences. Written so a teacher or parent understands immediately.

4. **Evidence over aspiration**: Four-week pilot data, one point four times faster in baseline, advisor with twelve years experience.

5. **Testable assumptions**: Every assumption has a one-week check with clear metrics and mitigation plans.

6. **Honest exclusions**: Elementary grades out of scope, alternative schools with low attendance excluded. This builds credibility.

7. **Delayed retention check**: Shows you care about real learning, not just short-term test scores.

Use this example as your north star when drafting your pitch.
