# S0 Pitch Template: [Your Project Name]

> This template guides you through creating your SuperBuilders S0 pitch. Complete all sections with clear, specific details. Remember: clarity over brevity, outcomes over features, and measurable over aspirational.

---

## 1. One-liner

### Format A: Business Structure
**Template**: For [ICP] who [pain/trigger], we help them [10x desired educational outcome] by [approach].

**Your one-liner:**
[Write your one-liner here]

**Natural restatement** (for teachers and parents):
[Rewrite the same idea in plain, conversational language]

---

### Format B: Movie Pitch
**Template**: It's like [familiar product A] meets [familiar product B], but with [unique feature one] and [unique feature two].

**Your movie pitch:**
[Write your movie pitch here]

**Notes:**
- Use well-known products (Duolingo, Khan Academy, Quizlet, Google Classroom, etc.)
- Make unique features concrete, not vague ("auto-generated intervention plans" not "more personalized")

---

## 2. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### School Category (Required)
**Which school(s) are you targeting?**
- [ ] Alpha school (name: ________________)
- [ ] Sister schools (specify network/category: ________________)

---

### Inclusion Rules
**Who is your ideal customer? Be specific enough that two reviewers would classify the same lead identically.**

**Grade band and subject:**
[Example: Grades six through eight, math (fractions and pre-algebra)]

**School type and setting:**
[Example: Charter schools with one-to-one Chromebook programs]

**Workflow constraints:**
[Example: Twenty to thirty minute intervention blocks, twice per week]

**Required tools or platforms:**
[Example: Google Classroom integration required, district uses Illustrative Math curriculum]

**Minimum scale:**
[Example: At least one hundred students per grade level]

---

### Exclusion Rules
**Where will your approach NOT work? Be explicit.**

**Grades or subjects out of scope:**
[Example: Elementary grades K through three, high school calculus]

**Settings that block your approach:**
[Example: Schools without reliable internet, districts that do not allow third-party tools]

**Programs where your target gap rarely appears:**
[Example: Gifted and talented programs, schools using mastery-based progression already]

**Other exclusions:**
[Any other situations where your product is not a good fit]

---

## 3. Strategic Narrative

### Why Now (Macro Timing)
**What external forces make this the right time?**
[Example: Adaptive content generation and auto-scoring are finally good and cheap enough to personalize at scale]

---

### Status Quo / Enemy (Current Problem)
**What is broken today? What does the status quo get wrong?**
[Example: Static materials and slow remediation cycles waste teacher time and leave gaps unaddressed for weeks]

---

### Promised Land (Your 10x Improvement)
**Why are you ten times better? What measurable outcome do you deliver?**
[Example: Students progress twice as fast on priority standards while teachers recover meaningful prep time]

---

### Proof (Why You Are Credible)
**What specific evidence shows you can deliver? Include two to three signals:**
- Pilot data or early trials
- Domain access or partnerships
- Advisor expertise
- Unique insight from the field

[Example: We have run early trials with two math departments and have an experienced curriculum advisor shaping the item bank]

---

## 4. Distribution and Platform

**What platform are you building on?**
[Example: Timeback module / standalone iOS app / web-based tool with Google signin]

**How will students access it on day one at your alpha school?**
[Example: Teacher enables a toggle in Timeback settings, students see the new module in their existing dashboard]

**Are there any integration blockers?**
[Example: None. Alpha school already uses Timeback for all student scheduling]

---

## 5. Measurable Outcome (The Centerpiece)

Complete all five components below. This is the most important section of your pitch.

### 1. What you will improve (Primary Outcome)
**What specific learning metric will you improve?**
[Examples: mastery on specific standards, retention after forty-eight hours, progress per thirty minutes of practice, time from low quiz to targeted intervention, teacher preparation time saved WITHOUT worse learning]

**Your primary outcome:**
[Write your primary outcome here]

---

### 2. How much you plan to improve (Target)
**What is your numeric, plausible target?**
[Examples: "twice as fast as our baseline," "an increase of at least twenty percentage points," "a reduction to forty-eight hours or less," "at least thirty minutes saved per week"]

**Your target:**
[Write your target here]

---

### 3. How long it will take (Time Window)
**What is your time window for seeing results?**
[Examples: "within fourteen days," "within thirty days," "within one unit"]

**Your time window:**
[Write your time window here]

---

### 4. How you will measure it (Measurement Plan)
**Explain your measurement approach so someone could audit it.**

Include:
- What instruments or checks you will use
- What materials (pre-tests, post-tests, released items, logs, etc.)
- How many learners (order of magnitude)
- Any delayed retention checks (forty-eight hours after, etc.)

**Your measurement plan:**
[Write your measurement plan here]

---

### 5. What counts as success (Decision Thresholds)
**Define your success criteria clearly.**

**Green (Success):**
[Example: Ninety percent of flagged students receive an intervention plan within forty-eight hours]

**Yellow (Needs More Work):**
[Example: Seventy to eighty-nine percent within forty-eight hours]

**Red (Not Acceptable):**
[Example: Below seventy percent or any delays beyond seventy-two hours]

---

### Complete Statement (Fill in the template)
**Template**: Our primary outcome is [what you will improve]. We aim to [target] within [time window]. We will measure this by [measurement plan]. We will consider this successful if [green threshold], needs more work if [yellow threshold], and not acceptable if [red threshold].

**Your complete measurable outcome statement:**
[Write your complete statement here]

## 6. Assumptions and Risks

List the few assumptions that matter most and how you will test them within thirty to sixty days. Each should include: what you assume AND how you will test or mitigate it.

### Assumption / Risk 1: [Name it]
**What you assume:**
[Example: Students will complete approximately twenty minutes per day with minimal prompting]

**How you will test it:**
[Example: Week one we will require a three-day streak and measure drop-off. If needed we will add streak cues and shorter first sessions]

---

### Assumption / Risk 2: [Name it]
**What you assume:**
[Your assumption]

**How you will test it:**
[Your testing plan]

---

### Assumption / Risk 3: [Name it]
**What you assume:**
[Your assumption]

**How you will test it:**
[Your testing plan]

---

### Assumption / Risk 4: [Name it] (Optional)
**What you assume:**
[Your assumption]

**How you will test it:**
[Your testing plan]

---

### Assumption / Risk 5: [Name it] (Optional)
**What you assume:**
[Your assumption]

**How you will test it:**
[Your testing plan]

---

## Common Assumptions to Consider

Include testing plans for any of these that apply:

- **Student engagement**: Will students use it consistently?
- **Curriculum alignment**: Do generated items match district scope and sequence?
- **Measurement validity**: Do your probes measure real learning, not just short-term recall?
- **Operator load**: Can teachers or parents set up in fifteen minutes or less?
- **Unit economics**: Do run costs support pilot-to-paid transition within six weeks?
- **Access and distribution**: Will students actually access the platform on day one?
- **Data integration**: Can you get the student data you need from existing systems?

## Need Help?

If you are stuck on any section, ask your AI coach:
- "Can you help me sharpen my measurable outcome?"
- "Is my ICP specific enough?"
- "Can you review my strategic narrative?"
- "What are good examples of [section name]?"

Remember: This is an iterative process. Your first draft does not need to be perfect. The goal is clarity and measurable outcomes. Work with your coach to refine each section.
