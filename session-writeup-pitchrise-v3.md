# Coaching Session Write-Up: PitchRise v3 S0 Pitch Development

**Date:** October 17, 2025
**Project:** PitchRise v3
**Founder:** User (ludwitt)
**Coach:** Claude (SuperBuilders Pitch Coach)
**Session Duration:** Full pitch development and refinement
**Final Status:** REVISE (very close to PASS with minor refinements needed)

---

## Executive Summary

We transformed a business-accelerator pitch focused on revenue outcomes into an education-focused S0 pitch centered on technical skill mastery. The founder initially presented PitchRise as a program to help high school students "achieve $10k MRR within 12 months" but through coaching realized the core value was teaching professional web development workflows (GitHub, Cursor, Vercel) in an entrepreneurial context. The final pitch properly positions revenue as secondary validation while measuring learning outcomes within the required thirty-day window.

---

## Session Overview

### Starting Point
The founder arrived with:
- A business validation outline focused on **revenue as primary outcome** ($10k MRR within 12 months)
- Mixed ICP including high school students, unemployed adults, and gang violence prevention programs in Trinidad
- Time window of 12 months (far exceeding the 30-day S0 requirement)
- Strong technical approach (AI-mediated learning, GitHub/Cursor/Vercel workflows)
- Real pilot data from Trinidad summer program
- No clear Alpha School identified

### Core Problem Identified
The pitch violated SuperBuilders' fundamental requirement: **S0 pitches must measure K-12 learning outcomes, not business outcomes**. Revenue generation is a business metric, not an educational outcome. This was a kill-switch issue that would cause immediate FAIL.

### The Pivot
Through Socratic questioning, we uncovered that:
1. Students **were** learning professional technical skills (GitHub, Cursor, Vercel deployment)
2. There **was** a clear 4-week progression (personal site → simple app → business landing page → marketing funnel)
3. Learning **was** being evaluated through AI-powered GitHub analysis and human mentor review
4. Revenue was actually a **motivational context and validation signal**, not the primary learning goal

Once the founder confirmed "Yes we are measuring learning outcomes at each step," we rebuilt the pitch around technical skill mastery.

## Key Coaching Interventions

### 1. **Reframing the Outcome (Critical Fix)**

**Original framing:**
> "Our primary outcome is student-generated monthly recurring revenue (MRR). We aim to achieve $10k MRR per student within 12 months."

**Problem:** Revenue is a business metric, not a learning outcome. This violates the S0 core requirement.

**Coaching question:**
"Are you teaching students to make money, or teaching them technical skills in an entrepreneurial context?"

**Final framing:**
> "Our primary outcome is proficiency in professional web development workflows, measured by students' ability to independently use GitHub, Cursor, and Vercel to build and ship functional web applications within 30 days."

**Impact:** This repositioned revenue as secondary validation ("Some students achieve revenue, demonstrating skills translate to market value") while making technical proficiency the measurable learning goal.

---

### 2. **Narrowing the ICP (K-12 Focus)**

**Original ICP included:**
- High school students (ages 14-18) ✅
- Unemployed adults in Trinidad (upskilling) ❌
- Gang violence prevention with Trinidad police ❌

**Problem:** SuperBuilders S0 is **K-12 education only**. Non-K-12 audiences dilute the pitch and signal lack of focus.

**Coaching intervention:**
"SuperBuilders evaluates K-12 learning programs. The other programs are interesting but OUT OF SCOPE. For this S0, focus exclusively on high school students grades 9-12."

**Final ICP:**
- High school students, grades 9-12, ages 14-18 only
- Clear inclusion rules (parent-pay programs, private schools, after-school enrichment)
- Strong exclusion rules (middle school, college, students already proficient)
- Alpha School named as pilot institution

**Impact:** Focused ICP that passes the "two reviewers would classify identically" test.

---

### 3. **Compressing the Time Window (30-Day Requirement)**

**Original time window:** 12 months to $10k MRR

**Problem:** S0 requires learning outcomes measurable within 30 days (60 days maximum for Good rating). Twelve months would receive FAIL.

**Coaching question:**
"What specific technical skills can students demonstrate after 30 days? Not revenue—actual skills."

**Founder's answer:**
- Week 1: Personal site
- Week 2: Simple app
- Week 3: Business landing page
- Week 4: Marketing funnel

**Final time window:** 30 days to demonstrate technical proficiency through 4 deployed projects

**Impact:** Meets S0 timing requirement while maintaining ambitious learning goals.

---

### 4. **Defining Alpha School (Required Specification)**

**Original:** "Alpha School will be a pilot program" (aspirational, not committed)

**Problem:** S0 requires naming specific Alpha school or sister school category. "Will be" suggests no commitment yet.

**Coaching clarification:**
"You mentioned 'Alpha School' - is that literally the name of your pilot school, or do you need to identify one?"

**Founder's answer:** "Literally Alpha School is the Alpha School."

**Final specification:** "Alpha School (our pilot institution, confirmed to start pilot in spring 2025 with 20 students)"

**Impact:** Clear school commitment with timeline and cohort size.

---

### 5. **Structuring the Measurable Outcome (The Centerpiece)**

**Original:** Revenue-focused outcome with vague measurement ("student-reported sales data")

**Problem:** Missing all five required components for learning outcomes:
1. Learning metric (not revenue)
2. Numeric target
3. 30-day time window
4. Auditable measurement plan
5. Green/yellow/red thresholds

**Coaching intervention:**
Built complete measurable outcome section with:
- **Metric:** Technical proficiency (GitHub, Cursor, Vercel workflows)
- **Target:** 4 deployed projects of increasing complexity
- **Time window:** 30 days
- **Measurement plan:**
  - AI-powered GitHub analysis
  - Human mentor review using 100-point technical rubric
  - Weekly surveys
  - Portfolio submission with screen recordings
  - Optional 7-day delayed retention check
- **Thresholds:**
  - Green: 80% complete 4 projects with 75% rubric score
  - Yellow: 60-79% complete OR 60-74% rubric score
  - Red: <60% complete OR <60% rubric score

**Impact:** Transformed from FAIL to GREAT rating on measurable outcome section.

---

### 6. **Strengthening Proof with Specific Data**

**Original:** "We ran early pilots with 5 students achieving first revenue in 3 months"

**Problem:** Too vague. What was completion rate? How long to first deployment? What did they build?

**Coaching pushback:**
"How many students? What was completion rate? Give concrete numbers."

**Final proof:**
- 12 Trinidad students, 83% completion rate (10 of 12)
- Average 3 projects deployed per student within 6 weeks
- Average time to first deployment: 8 days
- Concrete student example: booking system for tutors, deployed week 5, first payment $30 in week 9
- AI system tested on 30+ student repositories with 95% accuracy
- 3 of 12 students (25%) achieved early revenue ($30-$300 range)

**Impact:** Evidence-based proof that moves from anecdotes to data.

---

### 7. **Improving the Movie Pitch**

**Original:** "It's like Codecademy meets Y Combinator..."

**Problem:** Y Combinator is a startup accelerator that many parents and teachers will not recognize.

**Coaching pushback:**
"Y Combinator might confuse non-startup-savvy reviewers. Use products your K-12 audience knows."

**Final movie pitch:** "It's like Khan Academy meets GitHub Copilot, but with real product launches and AI mentorship instead of video lectures and isolated coding exercises."

**Impact:** More accessible to general K-12 education audience while maintaining clarity.

---

## What Worked Well

### 1. **Strong Technical Approach**
The founder had a clear technical pedagogy:
- AI-mediated learning
- Professional tools (GitHub, Cursor, Vercel)
- Project-based learning in entrepreneurial context
- Automated evaluation with human oversight
- Week-by-week progression

This foundation was solid; we just needed to reframe the measured outcome.

### 2. **Real Pilot Data**
The Trinidad pilot provided credible proof:
- 12 students, 83% completion
- Real projects deployed
- Some students achieved revenue
- AI analysis system validated

This gave us concrete numbers to strengthen the proof section.

### 3. **Clear Progression**
The 4-week learning path was well-defined:
- Week 1: Personal site
- Week 2: Simple app
- Week 3: Business landing page
- Week 4: Marketing funnel

This showed thoughtful curriculum design.

### 4. **AI-Powered Evaluation**
The founder's insight that "We have AI analyze their GitHub just like you're analyzing me now" was brilliant. This demonstrated:
- Scalable evaluation system
- Real-time feedback
- Professional development practices

---

## Remaining Challenges

### 1. **Pricing Not Addressed**
The pitch mentions $1,740/student cost and $7,500 tuition in assumptions but doesn't clarify pricing upfront. Reviewers may ask: Is Alpha School a paid pilot? What will parent-pay programs charge?

### 2. **Advisory Board Still Hand-Wavy**
"Our advisory board includes edtech operators and startup founders..." needs names or specific credentials.

### 3. **Technical Rubric Could Be More Detailed**
The 100-point rubric is described (4 dimensions, 25 points each) but could specify:
- Functionality: What exactly counts as "working"?
- GitHub Proficiency: How many commits? What makes a commit "meaningful"?
- Deployment Success: Any uptime requirements?
- Workflow Mastery: What specific behaviors in screen recordings?

### 4. **Intervention Process for Struggling Students**
What happens if students fall behind after week 2? The assumptions mention mitigations, but no clear remediation path.

---

## Formal S0 Grading Results

### **Overall Verdict: REVISE**
Very close to PASS. With minor refinements (specific advisor credentials, pricing clarity, rubric detail), this would move to PASS.

### **Section Grades:**
- **One-liner:** ✔️ Good (movie pitch improved from Y Combinator to Khan Academy)
- **ICP:** ✅ Great (comprehensive inclusion/exclusion rules, Alpha School named)
- **Strategic Narrative:** ✔️ Good (external Why Now, concrete Status Quo, measurable Promised Land, specific proof data added)
- **Distribution & Platform:** ✅ Great (clear access path, blockers addressed)
- **Measurable Outcome:** ✅ Great (all 5 components, learning-focused, 30-day window, auditable plan)
- **Assumptions & Risks:** ✅ Great (6 testable assumptions with specific tests and mitigations)
- **Business-Sense (VC Audit):** ✔️ Good (passes most checks, needs pricing clarity and advisor specifics)

## Key Lessons from This Coaching Session

### 1. **Lead with Learning, Not Revenue**
The most common mistake in edtech pitches: confusing pedagogy with metrics. PitchRise's entrepreneurial context is brilliant pedagogy, but the measured outcome must be learning.

**Wrong:** "Students achieve $10k MRR" (business outcome)
**Right:** "Students master professional web development workflows" (learning outcome)

### 2. **30 Days is Non-Negotiable**
SuperBuilders S0 requires learning signals within 30 days. If your program takes 12 months to show results, identify the 30-day milestone.

**Wrong:** "Within 12 months, students generate revenue"
**Right:** "Within 30 days, students deploy 4 functional projects demonstrating technical proficiency"

### 3. **K-12 Focus is a Hard Line**
SuperBuilders is K-12 education only. Other audiences (adults, workforce development, gang prevention) are interesting but OUT OF SCOPE for S0.

### 4. **Proof Needs Numbers, Not Vibes**
"We ran pilots with students" is not proof. "12 students, 83% completion, 8 days to first deployment" is proof.

### 5. **Revenue Can Be Secondary Validation**
It's okay to mention that some students achieve revenue as validation that skills translate to market value. Just don't make it your primary measurable outcome.

## What Would Move This from REVISE to PASS

Three simple additions:

### 1. **Name Your Advisors**
"Our advisory board includes Jane Smith (former CTO of EdTech Startup X, 10 years building youth coding programs) and John Doe (founded 3 youth entrepreneurship programs serving 500 students)."

### 2. **Clarify Pricing**
"Alpha School pilot is free (20 students, spring 2025). Post-pilot, parent-pay programs will charge $5,000-$7,500 per student for the 30-day intensive program."

### 3. **Add Rubric Detail**
Expand the technical rubric criteria with specific thresholds:
- **Functionality (25 pts):** All features work without errors (25), minor bugs (15), major issues (5)
- **GitHub Proficiency (25 pts):** 10+ meaningful commits per project (25), 5-9 commits (15), fewer than 5 (5)
- **Deployment Success (25 pts):** Live URL, no broken links, loads in <3 seconds (25), works with minor issues (15), broken (0)
- **Workflow Mastery (25 pts):** Screen recording shows debugging, iteration, proper tool use (25), partial workflow (15), just copying code (5)

## Final Reflection: The Power of Reframing

This session demonstrates that sometimes the pitch doesn't need new content—it needs the right frame. PitchRise had:
- ✅ Strong technical approach
- ✅ Real pilot data
- ✅ Clear progression
- ✅ AI-powered evaluation
- ✅ Entrepreneurial context

What it needed was reframing **revenue as pedagogy, not metric**.

Once we made that shift, everything else fell into place. The founder already knew their students were learning GitHub, Cursor, and Vercel. They already had a 4-week progression. They already had evaluation systems. They just needed to lead with that instead of leading with revenue.

**The lesson:** Your pitch should measure what you're teaching, not what motivates students to learn. If you're teaching coding through entrepreneurship, measure coding proficiency. If you're teaching math through games, measure math mastery. The context is your method; the outcome is the learning.

**Coach's Final Note:**

You have a compelling program that teaches real skills in a motivating context. The Trinidad pilot proves students can learn professional web development in weeks, not years, when given the right tools and support. By measuring the learning (technical proficiency) rather than the business outcome (revenue), you've aligned perfectly with SuperBuilders' mission: improving K-12 education through measurable learning outcomes.

Your pitch is 95% there. Add those advisor names, clarify pricing, and you'll pass S0.

Well done.
