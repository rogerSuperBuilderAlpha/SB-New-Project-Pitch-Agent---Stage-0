## 1. One-liner

### Format A: Business Structure
For non-technical high school students (ages fourteen to eighteen) who aspire to entrepreneurship but lack technical execution skills, we help them achieve ten thousand dollars monthly recurring revenue within twelve months by providing an AI-mediated "engineering team in a box" that enables rapid product development and market validation.

## 3. Strategic Narrative

### Why Now (Macro Timing)
The rapid evolution of AI coding tools (two thousand twenty-two to two thousand twenty-five) has slashed technical execution costs by ninety-nine point nine percent, making entrepreneurial action accessible to non-technical high school students.

---

### Status Quo / Enemy (Current Problem)
Traditional entrepreneurial education focuses on ideation without execution, leaving students with plans but no products.

---

### Promised Land (Your 10x Improvement)
PitchRise version three bridges this gap by providing an "engineering team in a box," enabling students to build and launch real businesses, achieving ten thousand dollars monthly recurring revenue ten times faster than conventional programs.

---

### Proof (Why You Are Credible)
- Early pilots with five students achieving first revenue in three months
- Partnerships with AI tool providers
- Advisory board of edtech and startup experts with deep youth entrepreneurship experience

**What platform are you building on?**
[MISSING - Required: Specify web-based, iOS app, Timeback module, etc.]

**How will students access it on day one at your alpha school?**
[MISSING - Required: Describe exact access path]

**Are there any integration blockers?**
[MISSING - Required: Address any potential blockers]

## 5. Measurable Outcome (The Centerpiece)

### 1. What you will improve (Primary Outcome)
**Primary outcome:** Student-generated monthly recurring revenue (MRR)

---

### 2. How much you plan to improve (Target)
**Target:** Ten thousand dollars MRR per student

---

### 3. How long it will take (Time Window)
**Time window:** Within twelve months of program start

---

### 4. How you will measure it (Measurement Plan)
**Measurement plan:**
We will track revenue through student-reported sales data, verified via payment platform integrations (Stripe, PayPal) across cohorts of twenty to one hundred students.

---

### 5. What counts as success (Decision Thresholds)

**Green (Success):**
Thirty percent of students reach ten thousand dollars MRR

**Yellow (Needs More Work):**
Ten to twenty-nine percent reach ten thousand dollars MRR

**Red (Not Acceptable):**
Fewer than ten percent reach ten thousand dollars MRR

---

### Complete Statement
Our primary outcome is student-generated monthly recurring revenue. We aim to achieve ten thousand dollars MRR per student within twelve months of program start. We will measure this by tracking revenue through student-reported sales data, verified via payment platform integrations (Stripe, PayPal) across cohorts of twenty to one hundred students. We will consider this successful if thirty percent of students reach ten thousand dollars MRR, needs more work if ten to twenty-nine percent reach ten thousand dollars MRR, and not acceptable if fewer than ten percent reach ten thousand dollars MRR.

## 6. Assumptions and Risks

### Assumption / Risk 1: Student Engagement
**What you assume:** Students will commit ten to twenty hours per week to project work.

**How you will test it:** In the first two weeks we will track time logs and project milestones. If engagement drops, we will introduce gamified progress cues and peer accountability groups.

---

### Assumption / Risk 2: AI Tool Efficacy
**What you assume:** AI tools (Cursor, v0) will generate functional code from student prompts.

**How you will test it:** In week one we will review prototype outputs with mentors and iterate prompt guides if outputs fail.

---

### Assumption / Risk 3: Market Validation
**What you assume:** Students can identify viable customer segments.

**How you will test it:** In month one we will test through customer discovery assignments and provide pivot support if initial ideas lack traction.

---

### Assumption / Risk 4: Mentor Scalability
**What you assume:** Human mentors can support ten students each with two hours per week.

**How you will test it:** We will measure mentor load in the pilot phase and automate routine feedback if mentors exceed capacity.

---

### Assumption / Risk 5: Unit Economics
**What you assume:** One thousand seven hundred forty dollars per student cost supports a seven thousand five hundred dollar average tuition.

**How you will test it:** We will track AI tool and mentorship costs from day one, adjusting pricing or streamlining operations if margins fall below seventy percent.
