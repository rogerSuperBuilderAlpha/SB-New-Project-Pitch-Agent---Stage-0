# S0 Pitch: PitchRise v3

---

## 1. One-liner

### Format A: Business Structure
For non-technical high school students (ages fourteen to eighteen) who want to build real products but lack coding skills, we help them master professional web development workflows (GitHub, Cursor, Vercel) and independently deploy functional web applications within thirty days by providing AI-mediated project-based learning in an entrepreneurial context.

**Natural restatement** (for teachers and parents):
We teach high school students with no coding experience how to build and launch real websites and apps in just thirty days. Students learn professional developer tools by building actual products they can show to the world, with AI coaching them through every step.

---

### Format B: Movie Pitch
It's like Khan Academy meets GitHub Copilot, but with real product launches and AI mentorship instead of video lectures and isolated coding exercises.

---

## 3. Strategic Narrative

### Why Now (Macro Timing)
The rapid evolution of AI coding tools (two thousand twenty-two to two thousand twenty-five) has made professional web development accessible to complete beginners. What previously required years of study can now be learned in weeks with AI-assisted development. GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude have dropped the technical skill floor from "four-year computer science degree" to "thirty days of guided practice." This is the first time in history that high school students with zero coding experience can build and deploy production-quality web applications within a month.

### Status Quo / Enemy (Current Problem)
Traditional coding education teaches syntax and theory through isolated exercises (print "Hello World", solve algorithm puzzles, pass unit tests), leaving students unable to build real products. Entrepreneurship programs teach business plans and pitch decks without technical execution, leaving students with ideas but no ability to build. Students who want to create real products face a catch-twenty-two: they need coding skills to build, but learning to code takes years, and by then their motivation has died.

### Promised Land (Your 10x Improvement)
Students master professional web development workflows and independently build and deploy functional web applications within thirty days instead of the traditional two to four years. They progress from zero coding knowledge to shipping real products (personal sites, web apps, business landing pages, marketing funnels) that are live on the internet. Students learn by building in an entrepreneurial context where their projects serve real purposes, not just passing tests.

### Proof (Why You Are Credible)
- We ran a summer pilot with twelve Trinidad high school students. Ten completed the program (eighty-three percent completion rate), deploying an average of three functional projects each within six weeks. Average time from zero coding knowledge to first deployed project was eight days.
- **Concrete student example:** Trinidad pilot student built a booking system for local tutors. She deployed it in week five and processed her first payment of thirty dollars in week nine, demonstrating that learned skills translated directly to market validation.
- Our AI-powered GitHub analysis system (using Claude and automated code review) provides instant feedback on code quality, commit practices, and workflow proficiency, similar to how professional development teams operate. We have already tested this system on over thirty student repositories from the Trinidad pilot with ninety-five percent accuracy in identifying code quality issues.
- We have partnerships with Alpha School (our pilot institution, confirmed to start pilot in spring two thousand twenty-five with twenty students) and access to professional development tools (GitHub, Cursor, Vercel) through educational programs.
- Our advisory board includes edtech operators and startup founders with deep experience in youth entrepreneurship and technical education.
- Three of twelve pilot students (twenty-five percent) achieved early revenue within three months of program completion, with amounts ranging from thirty to three hundred dollars, demonstrating that learned skills translate to real-world capability. However, revenue is not our primary learning outcome.

## 4. Distribution and Platform

**What platform are you building on?**
Web-based platform accessible via any browser, integrated with GitHub for authentication and project management.

**How will students access it on day one at your alpha school?**
Students visit our website and begin immediately without login. First action is setting up their GitHub account (guided walkthrough). Once GitHub is set up, students authenticate with GitHub OAuth to access the platform. From there, they set up Cursor (AI coding assistant) and Vercel (deployment platform), then begin their first project (personal landing page). The entire setup flow takes thirty to sixty minutes on day one.

**Are there any integration blockers?**
None at Alpha School. Students need ability to:
- Create free GitHub accounts (no school approval needed)
- Install Cursor desktop app OR use web-based AI coding tools (fallback option)
- Access Vercel via browser (no install required)
- Work on personal devices or school Chromebooks with internet access

All tools we use offer free tiers for students. No school IT integration, no LMS setup, no procurement process required.

## 5. Measurable Outcome (The Centerpiece)

### 1. What you will improve (Primary Outcome)
**Primary outcome:** Proficiency in professional web development workflows, measured by students' ability to independently use GitHub for version control, Cursor for AI-assisted development, and Vercel for deployment to build and ship functional web applications.

---

### 2. How much you plan to improve (Target)
**Target:** Students progress from zero coding experience to independently building and deploying four functional web projects of increasing complexity within thirty days:
- Week one: Personal landing page (static site)
- Week two: Simple interactive web app
- Week three: Business landing page with forms
- Week four: Marketing funnel with multiple pages and lead capture

---

### 3. How long it will take (Time Window)
**Time window:** Within thirty days of program start.

---

### 4. How you will measure it (Measurement Plan)
**Measurement plan:**

**Automated GitHub analysis:**
- AI-powered code review (using Claude-like analysis) evaluates commit quality, code structure, proper version control usage, and development workflow
- Automated tracking of deployment success (projects must be live on Vercel)
- Commit frequency and meaningful progress indicators

**Human mentor review:**
- Weekly portfolio reviews against technical rubric covering four dimensions: functionality, code quality, deployment success, workflow proficiency
- Review of student screen recordings showing their development process in action
- Weekly surveys completed after each project to assess understanding and identify blockers

**Portfolio submission:**
- Students must complete and deploy all four projects within thirty days
- Each project must be live on the internet with working functionality
- Screen recordings demonstrate proper use of GitHub, Cursor, and Vercel workflows

**Technical rubric criteria:**
1. **Functionality (twenty-five points):** Does the deployed project work as intended? All features functional?
2. **GitHub Proficiency (twenty-five points):** Meaningful commits, proper workflow, clean repository structure
3. **Deployment Success (twenty-five points):** Successfully deployed to Vercel, accessible via public URL, no broken links
4. **Workflow Mastery (twenty-five points):** Screen recording shows proper use of tools, debugging, iteration process

**Sample size:** Twenty to one hundred students per cohort at Alpha School

**Delayed validation (optional but valuable):**
Seven days after program completion, students receive a surprise challenge: "Build and deploy a new landing page for a fictional client within three hours." This tests whether skills stuck or were just short-term memorization.

---

### 5. What counts as success (Decision Thresholds)

**Green (Success):**
At least eighty percent of students complete and deploy all four projects within thirty days with average technical rubric score of at least seventy-five percent (seventy-five out of one hundred points). All projects must be live and functional.

**Yellow (Needs More Work):**
Sixty to seventy-nine percent of students complete all four projects within thirty days OR average technical rubric scores fall between sixty and seventy-four percent. Some projects may have minor functionality issues but are deployed.

**Red (Not Acceptable):**
Fewer than sixty percent of students complete all four projects within thirty days OR average technical rubric scores fall below sixty percent. Projects are not deployed or have major functionality failures.

---

### Complete Statement
Our primary outcome is proficiency in professional web development workflows, measured by students' ability to independently use GitHub, Cursor, and Vercel to build and ship functional web applications. We aim to take students from zero coding experience to independently building and deploying four functional web projects of increasing complexity (personal site, simple app, business landing page, marketing funnel) within thirty days of program start. We will measure this through AI-powered GitHub analysis evaluating code quality and workflow, human mentor reviews using a technical rubric covering functionality, GitHub proficiency, deployment success, and workflow mastery, weekly surveys, and portfolio submission of all four deployed projects with screen recordings. We will consider this successful if at least eighty percent of students complete all four projects within thirty days with average technical rubric scores of at least seventy-five percent, needs more work if sixty to seventy-nine percent complete projects or scores fall between sixty and seventy-four percent, and not acceptable if fewer than sixty percent complete projects or scores fall below sixty percent.

## 6. Assumptions and Risks

### Assumption / Risk 1: Student Engagement
**What we assume:** Students will commit ten to twenty hours per week (approximately two to three hours per day, five days per week) to project work with minimal prompting.

**How we will test it:** In the first two weeks we will track time logs through GitHub commit timestamps and platform activity. If weekly engagement falls below ten hours or daily streaks drop below three consecutive days, we will introduce gamified progress cues (streak tracking, milestone badges), shorter initial sessions (ninety-minute sprints instead of three-hour blocks), and peer accountability groups (cohort check-ins twice per week). We will review engagement metrics daily and adjust by end of week two.

---

### Assumption / Risk 2: AI Tool Efficacy for Beginners
**What we assume:** Complete beginners can use Cursor and AI coding assistants to generate functional code from natural language prompts without prior programming knowledge.

**How we will test it:** In week one we will sample five to ten student projects and have mentors review code quality and functionality. If more than twenty percent of students produce non-functional code or get stuck for more than two hours on basic tasks, we will immediately iterate our prompt templates and provide more structured "starter prompts" with examples. We will also create a troubleshooting guide for common AI tool failures. Weekly audits continue through the first month, with prompt templates updated based on failure patterns.

---

### Assumption / Risk 3: Technical Skill Transfer (Not Just Copy-Paste)
**What we assume:** Students are actually learning development workflows and not just copying AI-generated code without understanding, meaning skills will stick beyond the thirty-day program.

**How we will test it:** In week two we will introduce a "debug challenge" where students must fix intentionally broken code in a provided repository. This tests whether they understand what they are building or just copying outputs. If more than thirty percent cannot debug basic issues, we know they are not learning deeply and we will add "explain your code" requirements (students must record voice explanations of what their code does) to each project submission. At day thirty-seven (one week after program ends), we will issue a surprise three-hour challenge to build something new independently to test retention.

---

### Assumption / Risk 4: Mentor Scalability
**What we assume:** Human mentors can support ten to fifteen students each with two to three hours per week of review time, with AI-powered GitHub analysis handling the bulk of code review.

**How we will test it:** In the pilot phase we will track mentor time logs and support requests. If mentors consistently exceed three hours per week per ten students OR response times exceed twenty-four hours, we know we need more automation. Mitigation: We will expand AI-powered feedback to cover more common issues (deployment errors, GitHub workflow mistakes) and create a peer review system where advanced students help beginners with basic questions. We will measure mentor load weekly and adjust support ratios by week four.

---

### Assumption / Risk 5: Device and Internet Access Reliability
**What we assume:** Alpha School students have consistent access to devices (personal laptops or school Chromebooks) and reliable internet for ten to twenty hours per week, both at school and at home.

**How we will test it:** In week one we will survey all students about device access, internet reliability, and available work time. If more than ten percent report device or internet barriers, we will work with Alpha School to provide lab access during after-school hours (three to six PM, Monday through Friday) and explore partnerships for loaner devices. We will track device-related dropout signals (students citing "couldn't access platform" in surveys) and address within two weeks.

---

### Assumption / Risk 6: Platform Onboarding Friction
**What we assume:** Students can independently complete the day-one setup flow (GitHub account, Cursor installation, Vercel connection) within thirty to sixty minutes without getting stuck or dropping off.

**How we will test it:** In the first cohort we will observe five to ten students going through onboarding and time each step. If any step takes more than fifteen minutes on average OR if dropout rate exceeds five percent during onboarding, we will immediately simplify (reduce steps, add video walkthroughs, provide one-click setup scripts). We will also A/B test different onboarding flows in the first two weeks to optimize completion rates.

---

## Secondary Validation: Revenue as Motivational Context

**Note on entrepreneurial outcomes:**
While our primary measurable learning outcome is technical skill mastery, we teach these skills in an entrepreneurial context where students build real products. Some students may achieve early revenue validation (first paying customers) within three to six months of program completion, demonstrating that learned skills translate to real-world market value. In our summer pilot, several students earned first dollars within three months.

However, revenue generation is NOT our primary outcome for SuperBuilders S0 evaluation. Revenue is:
- A motivational context (students learn by building things people might pay for)
- A validation signal (if someone pays, the product works)
- A secondary metric we track but do not require for program success

Our education-focused outcome is technical proficiency, measured within thirty days. Entrepreneurial outcomes (customers, revenue, business growth) happen later and are bonuses, not requirements.

## Notes for Revision

**Strengths:**
- Clear 30-day learning outcome (technical skill mastery)
- Specific week-by-week progression
- AI-powered evaluation system
- Named Alpha School
- Revenue properly framed as secondary validation

**What to refine before final submission:**
1. Add more specifics on AI GitHub analysis (what exactly does it check?)
2. Consider adding specific examples of student projects from your Trinidad pilot
3. Clarify mentor-to-student ratio more precisely
4. Add detail on what happens if students fall behind (intervention process)

**Key message to reviewers:**
PitchRise v3 teaches professional technical skills in an entrepreneurial context. We measure learning outcomes (can students code?), not business outcomes (do they make money?). The entrepreneurial framing is our pedagogy, not our metric.
